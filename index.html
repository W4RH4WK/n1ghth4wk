		<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

		<p>
			Vanilla Shadowrun&trade; features a complicated rule set and while I don't know whether the game is even sufficiently balanced, I doubt this amount of complexity is needed to give the game enough depth to be enjoyable.
			Shadowrun 6<sup>th</sup> Edition</cite> was supposed to simplify the rules, but was rushed and arrived broken beyond repair in my opinion.
			On my search for a <em>simpler</em> version, I discovered Shadowrun Anarchy.
			Shadowrun Anarchy is based on 5<sup>th</sup> Edition and draws a lot of parallels while actually establishing its own, far simpler, rule set.
			This is the starting point for my approach.
		</p>

		<p>
			This document states the <em>homebrew</em> rules that will govern my play sessions.
			These rules are mostly based on Shadowrun Anarchy and will be extended over time.
			As always, the GM retains the right to overrule established rules.
			There is neither fluff nor lore here, just mechanics; everything else is found in the original books.
		</p>

		<h2 id="narrations">Turns and Narrations</h2>

		<p>
			Each <strong>Turn</strong>, every player has a chance to play out and describe their character's actions, along with other elements of the story going on around them.
			These descriptions are called <strong>Narrations</strong>, and as the game progresses these Narrations build on each other and form the story of the game.&nbsp;<cite>[SRA]</cite>
		</p>

		<p>
			The Turn Order is situation dependent and may be adjusted by spending <a href="#plot-points">Plot Points</a>.
			If push comes to shove, compare characters <span class="attr">A + E</span> to determine who goes first.
		</p>

		<h2 id="Tests">Tests</h2>

		<p>
			6-sided dice are used to determine the outcome of certain actions.
			Tests are typically opposed rolls, the attacker and defender roll dice simultaneously and compare <strong>Hits</strong>.
			The defender sets the threshold for the attacker.
			To speed things up, the GM may use a fixed threshold instead of a defender's roll.
		</p>

		<ul class="plain">
			<li><strong>Dice pool:</strong>
				The dice pool for attacker and defender is determined via <a href="#attributes">Attributes</a>, <a href="#skills">Skills, <a href="#amps">Amps</a>, and modifiers
			</li>
			<li><strong>Hits:</strong>
				<span class="dice">âš„</span> and <span class="dice">âš…</span> count as Hits
			</li>
			<li><strong>Net Hits:</strong>
				Hits exceeding the threshold are referred to as Net Hits
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="repeating-tests">Repeating Tests</h3>

		<p>Most Tests can be repeated for an accumulative <strong>-2</strong> modifier.</p>

		<h3 id="extended-tests">Extended Tests</h3>

		<p>
			Some Tests take far longer than a moment and therefore require the character to invest time.
			An Extended Test accumulates Hits over multiple rolls to meet a given (high) threshold.
			Each roll beyond the first suffers the regular <strong>-2</strong> modifier of <a href="#repeating-tests">Repeating Tests</a>.
			A fixed time interval is spent along with each roll.
		</p>

		<h3 id="teamwork-tests">Teamwork Tests</h3>

		<p>
			Outside combat, characters can work together to overcame various obstacles.
			A Teamwork Test is done by selecting a leader who will do the majority of the work.
			Other characters assist by rolling a corresponding Test.
			Each helper's Hit adds a bonus die to the leader's dice pool.
			The number of bonus dice is <strong>limited by the leader's Skill (or higher Attribute)</strong>.
		</p>

		<h3 id="glitch-die">Glitch Die</h3>

		<p>
			A <a href="#plot-points">Plot Point</a> can be spent to introduce the Glitch Die.
			The Glitch Die is rolled separate from the regular dice pool and does not count towards the Hits.
			The effect of the Glitch Die is an addition to the regular Tests's outcome.
		</p>

		<ul class="plain">
			<li><span class="dice">âš€</span>&nbsp;: Something bad happens</li>
			<li><span class="dice">âš…</span>&nbsp;: Something good happens</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="rounding">Rounding</h3>

		<p>All divisions are <strong>round down</strong> unless stated otherwise.</p>

		<h2 id="plot-points">Plot Points</h2>

		<p>
			Plot Points are tokens that can be redeemed for special effects.
			Both, players and the GM, have the ability to spend a Plot Point.
			When a Plot Point is spent, the spender hands the token to the opposition.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Players <strong>begin</strong> the game <strong>with 3 Plot Points each</strong> and may be awarded more points by the GM</li>
			<li>Players may have a <strong>maximum of 5 Plot Points</strong></li>
			<li>Players can only spend one Plot Point at a time</li>
			<li>The GM starts with 1 Plot Point</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Examples for special effects players can spend Plot Points on:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Add the Glitch Die to a roll</li>
			<li>Change your Turn Order</li>
			<li>Move twice as far</li>
			<li>Heal a one <span class="cond">ðŸ„¿</span> or <span class="cond">ðŸ…‚</span> (see <a href="#health">Health</a>)</li>
			<li>A character's sprites/device/etc. suddenly stop working for a moment</li>
			<li>Take a hit for another character in close proximity</li>
			<li>Take a free attack action against the NPC who just attacked you</li>
			<li>â€¦</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The following applies to the GM:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The GM may not use Plot Points to directly aid or hinder a player</li>
			<li>The GM can spend a Plot Point to introduce the <a href="glitch-die">Glitch Die</a></li>
			<li>GM can only spend 1 Plot Point per Turn</li>
			<li>GM can spend a Plot Point to influence the Turn Order</li>
		</ul>

			Health is represented by <em>Condition Monitors</em>, which come in two forms Physical and Stun.
			Each Condition Monitor consists of a number of boxes (<span class="cond">ðŸ„¿</span> / <span class="cond">ðŸ…‚</span>).
			When you take damage, you cross out the corresponding number of <span class="cond">ðŸ„¿</span> or <span class="cond">ðŸ…‚</span> boxes.

		<ul>
			<li>Number of <span class="cond">ðŸ„¿</span>: <span class="attr">S</span> / 2 + 8</li>
