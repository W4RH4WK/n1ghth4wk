		<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

		<p>
			Vanilla Shadowrun&trade; rules are complicated.
			Not knowing whether the game is sufficiently balanced, I doubt the amount of complexity is needed for the game to be enjoyable.
			6<sup>th</sup> Edition was supposed to simplify the rules, but was rushed and arrived broken beyond repair.
			On my search for a <em>simpler</em> version, I discovered Shadowrun Anarchy.
			Establishing its own, far simpler, rule set, Shadowrun Anarchy also draws lots of parallels to 5<sup>th</sup> Edition.
		</p>

		<p>
			This project establishes the <em>homebrew</em> rules for my game sessions.
			The rules are loosely based on Shadowrun Anarchy and subject to change.
			There is neither fluff nor lore here, just mechanics; everything else is found in the <a href="#books">official books</a>.

		<h2 id="narrations">Turns and Narrations</h2>

		<p>
			Each <strong>Turn</strong>, every player has a chance to play out and describe their character's actions, along with other elements of the story going on around them.
			These descriptions are called <strong>Narrations</strong>, and as the game progresses these Narrations build on each other and form the story of the game.&nbsp;<cite>[SRA]</cite>
		</p>

		<p id="turn-order">
			The <strong>Turn Order</strong> is situation dependent and may be adjusted by spending <a href="#plot-points">Plot Points</a>.
			If push comes to shove, compare characters <span class="attr">A + E</span> <a href="#attributes">Attributes</a> to determine who goes first.
		</p>

		<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

		<p>
			6-sided dice are used to determine the outcome of certain actions.
			A pool of dice is rolled and <strong>Hits</strong> are compared against a threshold stated in parenthesis or determined by the GM.
			Tests against other characters are rolled as an opposed test, where the opposition sets the threshold for the actor.
			To speed things up, the GM may use a fixed threshold instead of rolling for the opposition.
		</p>

		<ul class="plain">
			<li>
				<strong>Dice pool:</strong>
				The dice pools for actor and opposition is determined by <a href="#attributes">Attributes</a>, <a href="#skills">Skills</a>, <a href="#amps">Amps</a>, and modifiers
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Hits:</strong>
				<span class="dice">⚄</span> and <span class="dice">⚅</span> count as Hits
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Net Hits:</strong>
				Hits exceeding the threshold are referred to as Net Hits
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Glitch:</strong>
				When <strong>more than half</strong> the number of dice rolled come up as <span class="dice">⚀</span>, something bad happens in addition to the regular outcome of the Test.
				Glitches cannot happen on defense Tests.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Critical Glitch:</strong>
				When a Glitch happens while not achieving a single Hit, something devastating happens.
			</li>

		<h3 id="repeating-tests">Repeating Tests</h3>

		<p>Most Tests can be repeated for an accumulative <strong>-2</strong> modifier.</p>

		<h3 id="extended-tests">Extended Tests</h3>

		<p>
			Some Tests take far longer than a moment and therefore require the character to invest time.
			An Extended Test accumulates Hits over multiple rolls to meet a given (high) threshold.
			Extended Tests cannot last forever; at some point, characters reach the limit of their abilities.
			Each roll beyond the first suffers an accumulative <strong>-1</strong> modifier.
			When they run out of dice before meeting the threshold, the Test either fails or needs to be continued at a later point.
			A fixed time interval is spent along with each roll.&nbsp;<cite>[SR5]</cite>
		</p>

		<p>
			Glitches during an Extended Test nullify all Hits of the current roll.
			A Critical Glitch can only occur on the first roll, in which case the task fails spectacularly.
		</p>

		<h3 id="teamwork-tests">Teamwork Tests</h3>

		<p>
			Outside combat, characters can work together to overcame various obstacles.
			A Teamwork Test is done by selecting a leader who will do the majority of the work.
			Other characters assist by rolling a corresponding Test.
			Each Hit scored by the helpers grants a bonus die to the leader's dice pool.
			The number of bonus dice is <strong>limited by the leader's Skill</strong> (or higher Attribute).
		</p>

		<h3 id="rounding">Rounding</h3>

		<p>All divisions are <strong>round down</strong> unless stated otherwise.</p>

		<h2 id="plot-points">Plot Points</h2>

		<p>
			Plot Points are tokens that can be redeemed for special effects.
			Both, players and the GM, have the ability to spend Plot Points.
			When a Plot Point is spent, the spender hands the token to the opposition.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Players <strong>begin</strong> the game <strong>with 2 Plot Points each</strong> and may be awarded more points by the GM</li>
			<li>Players may have a <strong>maximum of 5 Plot Points</strong></li>
			<li>Players can only spend one Plot Point at a time</li>
			<li>The GM starts with 1 Plot Point, but can generate Plot Points for players as needed</li>
			<li>The GM may not use Plot Points to directly aid or hinder a player</li>
			<li>GM can only spend 1 Plot Point per Turn</li>
			<li>GM can spend a Plot Point to influence the Turn Order</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Examples for special effects players can spend Plot Points on:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Go first, bypassing the current <a href="#turn-order">Turn Order</a></li>
			<li>Move further without sacrificing an action</li>
			<li>Heal 1 <span class="cond">🄿</span> or <span class="cond">🅂</span> (see <a href="#health">Health</a>)</li>
			<li>Gain 1 <a href="#edge">Edge Point</a></li>
			<li>Take a hit for another character in close proximity</li>

		<h3 id="edge"><span class="attr">E</span>&emsp;Edge</h3>

		<p>
			Edge is a special Attribute that represents a character's luck.
			Characters start each day with a number of <strong>Edge Points</strong> equal to their <span class="attr">E</span>.
			They can spend an Edge Point in one the following ways to augment a roll.
		</p>

		<ul class="plain">
			<li><strong>Before roll:</strong> +1 die and <span class="dice">⚃</span> also counts as a Hit</li>
			<li><strong>After roll (no Glitch):</strong> Reroll all dice that did not come up as Hits</li>
			<li><strong>After roll (Glitch):</strong> Nullify a Glitch or turn a Critical Glitch into a Glitch</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="essence">Essence</h3>

		<p>
			Essence determines how <em>natural</em> your character is.
			Essence starts at 6 for all characters and is reduce by certain <em>unnatural</em> <a href="#amps">Amps</a> like Cyberware.
			For every full point of Essence lost, an accumulative -1 modifier is added to magic- and healing-related Tests.
		</p>

		<ul class="plain">

			This list is not exhaustive.
			New Skills can be added on the fly as the GM sees fit.
		</p>

		<p id="untrained">
			Most Skills can be used even when a character has not invested a single point into them.
			Such <strong>untrained</strong> Tests simply roll the associated Attribute.
		</p>

		<p id="perception">
			<strong>Perception</strong> is not a Skill, roll <span class="attr">L + W</span> for a Perception Test.
			(<span class="attr">L + W</span>) / 3 can be used for <em>passive</em> Perception.
		</p>

		<p id="specialization">
			A character can <strong>specialize</strong> in certain aspects of a (trained) Skill (e.g. Pistols of the Firearms Skill).
			A specialization grants a <strong>+2</strong> modifier to associated Tests.
		</p>

		<h3 id="qualities">Qualities</h3>

		<p>
			Qualities are additional character traits that come in positive and negative forms.
			Characters typically start out with 2 positive and 1 negative Quality.
		</p>

		<h3 id="amps">Amps</h3>

		<p>
			Every more-human-than-human improvement to your character is handled as an Amp.
			Ranging from cybernetic implants (Cyberware) to Spells, to Cyberdecks, etc.
		</p>

		<h3 id="health">Health</h3>

		<p>
			Health is represented by <em>Condition Monitors</em>, which come in two forms, Physical and Stun.
			Each Condition Monitor consists of a number of boxes (<span class="cond">🄿</span> / <span class="cond">🅂</span>).
			When you take damage, you cross out the corresponding number of <span class="cond">🄿</span> or <span class="cond">🅂</span> boxes.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Characters have 8 + <span class="attr">S</span> / 2 (round up) boxes of <span class="cond">🄿</span></li>
			<li>Characters have 8 + <span class="attr">W</span> / 2 (round up) boxes of <span class="cond">🅂</span></li>

			<li>When all boxes on one Condition Monitor are exhausted, the character becomes unconscious</li>
			<li>Stun damage carries over as Physical damage once the Stun Condition Monitor is exhausted</li>
			<li>
				When a character receives Physical damage after the Physical Condition Monitor is exhausted, they must make an <span class="attr">S + E</span> (1) Test, increasing the <a href="#difficulty">difficulty</a> each time they receive damage.
				If they fail the Test, the character is dead.

			Physical damage destroys armor in the process — Stun damage does not.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Armor cannot be restored during combat</li>
			<li>Armored clothing cannot be combined</li>
			<li id="armor-penetration">
				Attacks that have <var>n</var> <strong>Armor Penetration (AP)</strong> ignore <var>n</var><span class="cond">🄰</span> when dealing damage.
