	<h1 id="title">Shadowrun Alex</h1>

	<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
	<p>Shadowrun originally features a rather complicated rule set and while I don't know whether the game is actually
		sufficiently balanced to begin with, I think this amount of complexity might not be necessary to give the game
		enough depth to be enjoyable.
		Shadowrun 6<sup>th</sup> Edition</cite> was supposed to simplify a lot of the rules and streamline existing
		systems.
		However, 6<sup>th</sup> Edition was rushed and is now broken beyond repair in my opinion.
		On my search for a <em>simpler</em> version of Shadowrun, I discovered Shadowrun Anarchy, which is referred to
		as the <em>rules-lite</em> version of Shadowrun.
		Shadowrun Anarchy is based on 5<sup>th</sup> Edition and draws a lot of parallels while actually establishing
		its own rule set.
		This is the starting point for my approach.</p>

	<p>This document establishes the basic set of <em>homebrew</em> rules that will govern my play sessions.
		These rules are mostly based on Shadowrun Anarchy, but will be extended over time.
		As always, the GM retains the right to overrule the established rules.
		There is no fluff and no lore here, just mechanics; everything else is found in the original books.
		Descriptions are kept concise and sometimes incomplete.</p>

	<ul class="plain">
		<li><strong><cite>[SR:A]</cite>:</strong> Shadowrun Anarchy</li>
		<li><strong><cite>[SR:5]</cite>:</strong> Shadowrun 5<sup>th</sup> Edition</li>
		<li><strong><cite>[SR:6]</cite>:</strong> Shadowrun 6<sup>th</sup> Edition</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="narrations">Turns and Narrations</h2>

	<p>Each <strong>turn</strong>, every player has a chance to play out and describe their character's actions, along
		with other elements of the story going on around them.
		These descriptions are called <strong>Narrations</strong>, and as the game progresses these Narrations build on
		each other and form the story of the game.&nbsp;<cite>[SR:A]</cite></p>

	<p>The order is situation dependent and may be adjusted by spending <a href="#plot-points">Plot Points</a>.
		If push comes to shove, characters <span class="attr">A</span> + <span class="attr">E</span> can be compared to
		determine who goes first.</p>

	<h2 id="checks">Checks</h2>
	<p>6-sided dice are used to determine the outcome of certain actions.
		Checks are typically <em>opposed</em> rolls, the attacker and defender roll dice simultaneously and compare.
		The defender sets the threshold for the attacker.
		To speed things up, the GM may use a fixed threshold instead of a defender's roll.

	<ul class="plain">
		<li><strong>Dice pool:</strong>
			The dice pool for attacker and defender is determined via Attributes, Skills, Amps, and situational
			modifiers
		</li>
		<li><strong>Hits:</strong>
			<span class="dice">âš„</span> and <span class="dice">âš…</span> count as hits
		</li>
		<li><strong>Net hits:</strong>
			Hits exceeding the threshold are referred to as net hits
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3 id="repeating-checks">Repeating Checks</h3>
	<p>Most checks can be repeated for an accumulative <strong>-2 dice</strong> modifier.</p>

	<h3 id="extended-checks">Extended Checks</h3>
	<p>Some checks take far longer than a moment and therefore require the character to invest time.
		An extended check accumulates hits over multiple rolls to meet a given (high) threshold.
		Each roll beyond the first suffers the regular <strong>-2 dice</strong> modifier of
		<a href="#repeating-checks">repeating checks</a>.
		A fixed time interval is spent along with each roll.
	</p>

	<h3 id="teamwork-checks">Teamwork Checks</h3>
	<p>Outside combat, characters can work together to overcame various obstacles.
		A Teamwork Check is done by selecting a leader who will do the majority of the work.
		Other characters my assist by rolling a corresponding check.
		Each helper's hit adds a bonus die to the leader's dice pool.
		The number of bonus dice is <strong>limited by the leader's Skill (or higher Attribute)</strong>.
	</p>

	<h3 id="glitch-die">Glitch Die</h3>
	<p>A <a href="#plot-point">Plot Point</a> can be spent to introduce the Glitch Die.
		The Glitch Die is rolled separate from the regular dice pool and does not count towards the hits.
	</p>

	<ul class="plain">
		<li><span class="dice">âš€</span>&nbsp;:
			Something bad happens in addition to the regular checks outcome
		</li>
		<li><span class="dice">âš…</span>&nbsp;:
			Something good happens in addition to the regular checks outcome
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="plot-points">Plot Points</h2>
	<p>Plot Points are tokens that can be redeemed for special effects.
		Both, players and the GM, have the ability to spend a Plot Point.
		When a Plot Point is spent, the spender gives it to the opposition.
	</p>

	<p>Players <strong>begin</strong> the game <strong>with 3 Plot Points each</strong> and may be awarded more points
		by the GM.
		Players may have a <strong>maximum of 5 Plot Points</strong>.
		Players can only spend one Plot Point at a time.
		The GM starts with 1 Plot Point.</p>

	<p>Examples for special effects players can spend Plot Points on:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Add the Glitch Die to a roll</li>
		<li>Change your turn order</li>
		<li>Move twice as far</li>
		<li>Heal a box of <span class="cond">ðŸ„¿</span> or <span class="cond">ðŸ…‚</span></li>
		<li>A character's sprites / device / etc. suddenly stop working for a moment</li>
		<li>Take a hit for another character in close proximity</li>
		<li>Take a free attack action against the NPC who just attacked you</li>
		<li>â€¦</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The following applies to the GM:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The GM may not use Plot Points to directly aid or hinder a player</li>
		<li>The GM can spend a Plot Point to introduce the <a href="glitch-die">Glitch Die</a></li>
		<li>GM can only spend 1 Plot Point per turn</li>
		<li>GM can spend a Plot Point to influence the initiative order</li>
	</ul>
